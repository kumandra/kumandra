Governance Pallet: This pallet would handle the governance aspects of the platform, allowing participants to propose and vote on system upgrades, parameter changes, or new features. It would include functions for proposal submission, voting mechanisms, and execution of approved changes.

The Governance Pallet handles the governance aspects of the platform, allowing participants to propose and vote on system upgrades, parameter changes, or new features. It includes the following functions:

submit_proposal: Allows an account to submit a proposal by providing a proposal hash and associated data. The proposal is stored in the Proposals storage, and an event is emitted to indicate the submission.

vote_proposal: Enables users to vote on a proposal by providing the proposal hash and their vote (either Aye or Nay). The vote is recorded in the ProposalVotes storage, and an event is emitted to indicate the vote.

execute_proposal: Executes a proposal by providing the proposal hash. The function verifies that the proposal exists and checks if it has received enough votes to be approved. If the conditions are met, the proposal is executed, removed from storage, and an event is emitted.

The pallet defines storage items for storing proposals (Proposals) and proposal votes (ProposalVotes). It also defines events to notify when a proposal is submitted, voted on, or executed.

Custom voting logic can be implemented in the is_approved function, which determines whether a proposal has received enough votes to be approved.
